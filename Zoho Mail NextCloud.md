Configuring Zoho Mail as your email server in Nextcloud involves a few key steps. Here’s how you can do it:
---

# Step 1: Set Up Zoho Mail
Enable IMAP:</br>
Log in to your Zoho Mail account: https://accounts.zoho.com/signin?servicename=AaaServer&serviceurl=https%3A%2F%2Faccounts.zoho.com%2Fhome

Go to Settings > Mail Accounts > IMAP Access and ensure that IMAP is enabled.
Step 2: Configure Nextcloud Mail App
Install the Mail App:

Log in to your Nextcloud instance.
Go to the Apps section and find the Mail app. Install it if you haven’t done so.
Access Mail Settings:

After installing, navigate to the Mail app.
Click on the Settings icon (usually a gear or wrench icon).
Add Your Zoho Account:

Select Add Account or similar option.
Fill in the required information:
Email Address: Your full Zoho email address (e.g., you@yourdomain.com).
Username: Your full Zoho email address again.
Password: Your Zoho email password.
Configure Incoming Server:

Server Type: IMAP
Server Address: imap.zoho.com
Port: 993
Security: SSL/TLS
Authentication: Normal password
Configure Outgoing Server:

Server Address: smtp.zoho.com
Port: 465 (SSL) or 587 (TLS)
Security: SSL/TLS
Authentication: Normal password
Save Settings: After entering all the details, save your settings.

Step 3: Test the Configuration
Send and Receive Emails: Try sending and receiving emails to ensure everything is configured correctly.
Check for Errors: If you encounter issues, double-check the settings, especially the server addresses, ports, and security settings.
Troubleshooting
Connection Issues: Ensure that your Nextcloud server can connect to the Zoho Mail servers. Check firewall settings if necessary.
Authentication Failures: Make sure you are using the correct email and password. You may also need to enable "Allow less secure apps" in your Zoho account settings if you face issues.
Two-Factor Authentication: If you have 2FA enabled on Zoho, you might need to create an app-specific password for Nextcloud.
Additional Tips
Backup: Always back up your Nextcloud data before making major changes.
Documentation: Refer to the Nextcloud Mail app documentation and Zoho Mail support for any specific configurations or updates.
This should help you get your Zoho Mail configured in Nextcloud! If you run into any specific issues, feel free to ask for more help.
