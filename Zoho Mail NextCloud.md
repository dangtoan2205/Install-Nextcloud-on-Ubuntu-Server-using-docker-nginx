Access Mail Settings: </br>

After installing, navigate to the Mail app. </br>
Click on the Settings icon (usually a gear or wrench icon). </br>
Add Your Zoho Account: </br>

Select Add Account or similar option. </br>
Fill in the required information: </br>
Email Address: Your full Zoho email address (e.g., you@yourdomain.com). </br>

Step 3: Test the Configuration
Send and Receive Emails: Try sending and receiving emails to ensure everything is configured correctly.
Check for Errors: If you encounter issues, double-check the settings, especially the server addresses, ports, and security settings.
Troubleshooting
Connection Issues: Ensure that your Nextcloud server can connect to the Zoho Mail servers. Check firewall settings if necessary.
Authentication Failures: Make sure you are using the correct email and password. You may also need to enable "Allow less secure apps" in your Zoho account settings if you face issues.
Two-Factor Authentication: If you have 2FA enabled on Zoho, you might need to create an app-specific password for Nextcloud.
Additional Tips
Backup: Always back up your Nextcloud data before making major changes.
Documentation: Refer to the Nextcloud Mail app documentation and Zoho Mail support for any specific configurations or updates.
This should help you get your Zoho Mail configured in Nextcloud! If you run into any specific issues, feel free to ask for more help.
